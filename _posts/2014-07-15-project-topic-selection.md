This is the first week of my project. The lecturers of mine has selected the "Online Community Engagement" as the main project. I have not yet decided a name for this. So I am thinking about the way in which the app should be organized. I would love to provide each and every facility but due to time limitation I am not sure of how much I can deliver. That is indeed a thing you gain with experience alone. 

First of all, I have to help my groupmates catchup with RoR as I am planning to do it in RoR. Then again I have to first decide the way in which it should be done. Thinking forward I have to decide the gems which I have to use. The remaining is indeed a mystery which will show itself in the coming days.

The mentor of our group seems to be knowledgable and friendly. Knowledgable is true. But friendly, I do not know whether she plans to backstab us. It is also something we will find out with time. I hope she does not backstab us because I seem to like her as a friend more than a lecturer. I would like to believe so but experience proves otherwise.

Another foolish thing is the new rules and requirements for the project put forth by teachers. Every student has to submit a written copy of weekly report. Also we have to keep a notebook for project purposes as well as a file. What idiocy it is. Computer students are asked to write reports - handwrite that is. It is too bad that the teachers are like this. I would have loved to study in another college but in terms of computers I am happy that I ended up here. I got lucky and met a prodigy who changed my views about computers and computing for ever - Ershad Kunnakkadan. Whatever it is, lets hope that the our mentor is a good person.

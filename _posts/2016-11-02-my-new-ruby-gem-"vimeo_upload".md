I tried to create a ruby gem of my own and apparently it went well. This gem is for uploading videos to vimeo. It also has a part where it changes the title of an already uploaded video as well. The gem can be found in [Github](https://github.com/sajinmp/vimeo_upload) and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/vimeo_upload).

Please go through and notify me if something could be done better. I welcome all help that I could get to make it better. Thanks.

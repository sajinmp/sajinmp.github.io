I just created my stackoverflow careers account. I got it thanks to an invite from [Kevin Jayanthan](http://limekin.github.io). Although I used stackoverflow and stackexchange sites to solve many of my problems, I never once thought of contributing there. Now a days most of the time I am present there trying to give answers to questions posted. If I am unable to answer then I could learn something new from that. It is an awesome experience. Thanks Kevin.

Btw my stackoverflow careers profile is [here](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/sajinmp).

I went to the startup village to participate in the hackathon - Angel hack 2015. I was alone but with luck I found one of my aquaintances over there who was also alone. So we got together as a team and began developing. We had to develop an application in one day which solved a real life problem. 
This was my very first hackathon. So I do not know what to do or how to do anything. We spent half the day thinking of what to do. Finally what was thought up was to build an android application which can access the camera to take an image and from that image we find faces. After the face is found we check whether the person is present in the contacts. After 10 mins of discussing this plan we understood that a single day won't suffice in comppleting this particular project. 

So I then suggested an online community engagement platform. I wanted to pitch the idea infront of a crowd and wanted to know the response that they had. So we started building on it. We created polls, guestbook, forums and q & a. That was the time we got.

Between this process, there was a lot of fun. During the first day the people from HP, IBM, ClusterPoint and AWS gave some talk and an intro to theeir APIs which we are gonna use. The food was extravagant. It was very delicious and lavish. During the night there was pepsi and mirinda cans and chips to get rid of our sleeps. There were games at 2 AM. It was a lot of fun.

Unfortunately an accident occured just before the demo. I just reset the database. When I migrated it again an error showed up. It was due to my own carelessness. I couldn't find it then and there. So our demo was cancelled. BTW, my friend had some urgent business to attend to and he left before the demo. So I was alone. 

If I forget the matter of not being able to show the demo, then I had a lot of fun and did lot of coding. I also got introduced into android by my friend. I look forward to participating in another hackathon.

The application developed can be found on [Github](https://github.com/sajinmp/opinia). A demo is hosted in [Heroku](http://opinia.herokuapp.com).

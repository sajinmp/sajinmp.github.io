Now there is yet another hurdle for me to pass before doing the project. My friend, the bloody idiot Ajil, gave me yet another job. He said to his father, who is also the new Administrator of my college that I am building a website for my college which presently has no website. He asked to do it in a good way so that a grand ceremony can be conducted for its release alongwith the release of the college magazine, the money of which was robbed by an interim administrator.

This is indeed a big blow for me since I planned to do it very slowly in my leisure time which is very very small. But now I have to try and finish it within the onam vacation and the site should look lovely. 

The onam vacation has in store for me a lot of work. I have to go to many places attend many functions of which one is very very very important. In the midst of all these how am I going to complete the work of the college website. How!!!!

I will try my best but the date for the internals are already fixed and the teachers of mine expects and believes that I will pass the exam with flying colors. Along with learning I have to tend to all the engagements of mine. Lets see how everything goes.

Hi there. Just a heads up that my main project is complete. Its been so long since I said I am starting it but then all my enthusiasm just vanished. But I have completed it now. I started it just 2 days before the submission date. So it is not done properly. Most may not like it.

Well, I have completed my bachelors degree. Now I am sitting idly in my home. I want to take some rest before proceeding to the next phase. Just want some enjoyment. I am planning to learn some things during my rest and then apply for a job somewhere. 

You can find my main project in Gitlab. [Click here](https://gitlab.com/sajinmp/opinia)

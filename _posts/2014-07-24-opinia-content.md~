Yesterday we sat together and decided on the pages required for the site from a user point of view. The admin has not yet been setup. Nothing for admin has been decided. The pages has been decided. So next we have to find a base design and draw the mockups for the pages. Adarsh is the pioneer behind the page design and he also agreed to draw the mockups. 

I think there is a lot more to do before actually doing it. But the happiest thing for me is that Adarsh is actually enjoying learning Ruby. He says it is interesting. I also have to study. He says he is planning to take leave in next semester to go for internship until the period of doube condonation. We have a project leave for a month or so. Basically there is no problem even if he takes extra month leave I think.

If he learns well and proves himself that he can indeed learn, I am planning to add him to my company which I plan to register by the end of this semester. In the meantime we are trying to find a project that we can do to make some cash. Main project can be done alongwith in sparetime.

Meanwhile I coined a name for the project - 'Opinia'. I just got it from the word opinion. The rest we will see as to what will happen.

Yesterday we sat together and decided on the pages required for the site from a user point of view. The admin has not yet been setup. Nothing for admin has been decided. The pages has been decided. So next we have to find a base design and draw the mockups for the pages. Adarsh is the pioneer behind the page design and he also agreed to draw the mockups. 

If he learns well and proves himself that he can indeed learn, I am planning to add him to my company which I plan to register by the end of this semester. In the meantime we are trying to find a project that we can do to make some cash. Main project can be done alongwith in sparetime.

Meanwhile I coined a name for the project - 'Opinia'. I just got it from the word opinion. The rest we will see as to what will happen.

This is my first post after moving to jekyll and github pages. I have been using wordpress but I was always distant from it. Then when I looked at github pages and learned that I could use Jekyll, well, there was no more second thoughts.

I took the layouts and all other setting from [Nithin Bekal](https://github.com/nithinbekal/nithinbekal.github.io)  who had a running version of the same. That is all about that. I am planning to change the styles and all after some time.

So I am starting bloggin then.

In the first week I have submitted my first year project topics with their abstract to the HOD. One of these was my own idea. We have to wait and see which one will get selected. The teachers here say that we have to select topics which have an IEEE paper as base.

I do not understand the relation between IEEE and CSE. What is IEEE? It is nothing but for electrical and electronics. These teachers, instead if allowing us to harness on our ideas and build on it, are asking us to use someone else's idea to make something I right now do not understand.

Anyhow, what I submitted was three topics for which I did not even search for base papers. One is something that I got from my previous company which I worked in - "Bang The Table". It is an 'Online Community Engagement' application. It is the same one created by 'Bang The Table'. Since I believe that it will have a lot of work to do. I am dying to do it. I will learn a lot by doing it.

Another of the projects is a forum software which I became interested in while using sites like "http://weindians.net/vbforum/", "http://malluspecial.com" and so on of which some does not work today. It is also an interesting project which will make me do a lot of work.

The third and last one is one that I have no experience with till today. But ironically the very idea came in my head. It is something using image processing. I planned a web browsing app which enables a user to freely navigate and control facebook using hand jesters and voice recognition. But I do not know anything about image processing. So I believe myself to have a hard time but also being able to learn an entirely new thing.

A project which I suggested to my friend is a face recognition password system. Using webcam a user will be capable of logging into any of his account online. This will give rise to a browser app as well as a program software. It is an interesting one but he also had an idea and wanted to do that. I was happy because of the fact that he took it seriously and even made an idea for which he believes working hard is worth it.

The teachers here are unable to think about the importance of allowing students to improve themselves and learn while doing. Almost all students are going to other places to do their projects giving money to companies and all. This removes one of their chances to improve.

Well anyhow lets see which project they choose for me. Forgot to mention, projects are done in groups of three. My group members are - Adarsh M P and Samsraj R. Our mentor is 'Asst. Prof. Reshna Wilson' who I seem to like a lot. Lets see how everything goes.
